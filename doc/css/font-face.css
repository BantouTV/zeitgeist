Typography - @font-face rules.
By Christopher Boone: http://hypsometry.com

The Hypsometry Blog uses IM FELL Great Primer, in its roman, italic, and small capitals variants. This
typeface was cut by Peter de Walpergen. The roman and small capitals were acquired by John Fell in 1684,
and the italic in 1687. It was originally printed at 17 points, and is being used here at 18 pixels.
Igino Marini digitally reproduced this typeface family, as well as a slew of other Fells.

The CSS in this file is based on files generated by the Font Squirrel: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator
That CSS is, in turn, based on the work of Paul Irish: http://paulirish.com/2009/bulletproof-font-face-implementation-syntax/

Notes:

- IM Fell Great Primer is being defined three times, once for the roman, once for the italic,
  and once for the small capitals.
- In each case, I'm first providing the EOT URL for IE. IE cannot understand format hints, so
  the EOT src value is provided on its own.
- In some cases, due to a buggy and inconsistent implementation of @font-face, Opera will fail
  to display the proper typeface if an EOT is declared on its own line, first in the list.
  But only in some cases. Not here, it appears.
- Next I list the possible local names of the font. It's not particularly likely that any reader
  already has a copy, but a couple lines of gzipped CSS are worth the try. In all cases I list
  the typeface's real name first, followed by its Postscript name, for Safari to use. Then the more
  general family name, in case that matches better. The roman and italic of IM FELL Great Primer
  are distributed in two editions (pro and regular), so I list the pro names first, followed by
  the non-pro.
- Then comes the data most likely to be displayed in the browser: the OpenType (in the case of
  the roman and italic) and TrueType (in the case of the small capitals) font files, included inline
  via the data URL technique, encoded in base 64. This increases overall file size, but reduces by 3/4
  the number of font related downloads. Also, the server that the Hypsometry Blog lives on doesn't
  enjoy gzipping font files, but loves to gzip CSS. The major downside of this technique is that
  the browsers that can't use this data - IE, Mobile Webkit, and Chrome - still have to download it,
  in addition to whatever other data they need.
- The format hint in the case of the OpenType and TrueType font src is actually optional, since
  Safari, Firefox, and Opera will treat OpenType and TrueType fonts appropriately regardless of
  which format you indicate; but I've included it for clarity.
- Last comes the SVG URL, provided for Mobile Webkit and Chrome.
- All the font files - whether included inline or served from /typefaces - are only subsets of their
  distributed glory. Currently they include the basic Latin glyphs and some additional punctuation.
- According to the spec, we should be able to specify multiple forms of the same font-family, using
  multiple @font-face declarations, each containing different styling information. Currently, this is
  poorly supported. Using font-style: italic, as I've done here, seems to work. I've used the same
  font-family in two @font-faces, and when I call for the italic version in the site's CSS Firefox
  and Safari seem to do the right thing. On the other hand, this technique does not work for font-variant:
  small-caps. As such, I've had to declare a different font-family name for the small capitals
  variant, and use that name - and not the appropriate font-variant: small-caps - in the CSS.
